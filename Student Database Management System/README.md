Student Database Management System

A simple Python + MySQL project where I’m building a mini student management system from scratch.
This project is my way of learning Python, SQL, and database design by actually coding instead of just reading tutorials.

Features (so far)

✅ Add new students (with input validation)

✅ View all students

🔄 Update student details (currently debugging field validation)

🔍 Search students by name, email, or major (still tweaking validation & query)

🗑️ Delete student records (basic version done)

Database Structure

students → stores student info

courses → stores course info

enrollment → many-to-many relationship between students & courses

What I’m Working On Next

Fixing bugs in update & search functions

Adding proper JOIN queries for course enrollments

Making validation more robust (e.g. regex checks, date formatting)

Writing cleaner error handling

Why I Built This

I wanted to push myself beyond tutorials and actually struggle through building a project.
Yes, there are bugs. But that’s the point — this repo shows my process, not just the final result.
